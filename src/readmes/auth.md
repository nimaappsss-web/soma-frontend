# Nima Authentication Architecture

## Overview

Nima uses a multi-tenant, role-based authentication system designed specifically for Nigerian secondary schools. The architecture supports offline-first sync with multiple devices per user.

---

## User Roles & Access Model

### Three Core Roles

1. **Admin (Principal)**
   - Full access to school's entire database
   - Manages teachers, students, classes, and all academic data
   - Account owner for the school tenant
   - Can invite teachers and manage school settings

2. **Teacher**
   - Access scoped by assignments only
   - Can view/edit data for assigned classes and subjects
   - Two types of assignments: form teacher + subject teacher
   - Cannot see other teachers' data or unassigned classes

3. **Bursar (Finance Officer)**
   - Read-only access to academic data
   - Full access to fee records and payment tracking
   - Cannot modify grades or attendance
   - Finance-focused dashboard

### Teacher Assignments Model

Teachers don't have a single role—they have **multiple assignments**. One teacher can be:

- **Form Teacher** for JSS 1A (take attendance, see full student profiles)
- **Subject Teacher** for Mathematics in JSS 1A, JSS 1B, JSS 2A (enter grades for each)
- Or any combination

**Database Model:**
```
Teacher {
  id: string
  schoolId: string
  name: string
  email: string
  role: 'teacher' | 'admin' | 'bursar'
  passwordHash: string
  createdAt: number
}

TeacherAssignment {
  id: string
  teacherId: string
  schoolId: string
  type: 'form' | 'subject'
  classId: string
  subjectId?: string  // only for subject assignments
}
```

**Access Example:**
```
Mr Adeyemi has 3 assignment records:
1. { type: 'form', classId: 'jss1a' }
2. { type: 'subject', classId: 'jss1a', subjectId: 'mathematics' }
3. { type: 'subject', classId: 'jss1b', subjectId: 'mathematics' }

He can:
✅ Take attendance in JSS 1A (form teacher)
✅ Enter grades for Math in JSS 1A and JSS 1B (subject teacher)
❌ View or edit any data in JSS 2A
```

## Registration & Onboarding Flows

### Flow 1: Principal Registration (Two-Step Process)

The principal registers first, then registers the school in a separate step.

**Step 1: Register Principal**
- Full Name
- Email (optional)
- Phone
- Password
- Profile Image URL (optional, upload via `/api/upload` first)

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/auth/register-principal
{
  "principalName": "Dr. Adebayo Okonkwo",
  "principalEmail": "principal@greenfield.sch.ng",
  "principalPhone": "08012345678",
  "password": "SecurePass123",
  "imageUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."  // optional
}

Response:
{
  "message": "Principal registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_abc123",
    "name": "Dr. Adebayo Okonkwo",
    "email": "principal@greenfield.sch.ng",
    "phone": "08012345678",
    "role": "PRINCIPAL",
    "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
  },
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGc..."
}
```

**Step 2: Register School** (requires bearer token from step 1)
- School Name
- State (dropdown)
- LGA (dropdown)
- School Type (Secondary/Primary)
- School Logo URL (optional, upload via `/api/upload` first)

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/auth/register-school
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
{
  "schoolName": "Greenfield Secondary School",
  "state": "Lagos",
  "lga": "Ikeja",
  "schoolType": "secondary",
  "logoUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."  // optional
}

Response:
{
  "message": "School registered successfully",
  "school": {
    "id": "school_abc123",
    "name": "Greenfield Secondary School",
    "logo": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "state": "Lagos",
    "lga": "Ikeja",
    "schoolType": "secondary"
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "user_abc123",
    "name": "Dr. Adebayo Okonkwo",
    "role": "PRINCIPAL",
    "image": null,
    "schoolId": "school_abc123"
  },
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",   // new token with schoolId populated
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGc..."
}
```

**Client Flow:**
1. Show principal registration form (step 1)
2. On success, save tokens to secure storage
3. Show school registration form (step 2)
4. Send token in `Authorization` header with school data

### Flow 2: Teacher Invite & Onboarding

Teachers **never** self-register. The principal invites them.

**Principal Action:**
1. Principal goes to "Add Teacher" in dashboard
2. Enters teacher's name, email, phone, and their assignments
3. Clicks "Send Invite"

**Backend Creates:**
- Teacher record with `role: 'teacher'`, NOT YET active
- Invitation token (one-time, expires in 48 hours)
- Sends email with accept link: `nima.com/invite/token123?school=greenfield`

**Teacher Action:**
1. Teacher clicks link from email
2. Lands on "Set Your Password" page showing which school invited them
3. Sets password and clicks "Accept Invite"
4. Teacher record is now `active: true`
5. Teacher logs in normally

**Page:**
```
You've been invited to join
Greenfield Secondary School on Nima

Set your password to get started
─────────────────────────────
Password          [                    ]
Confirm Password  [                    ]

[Accept Invite]
```

## Login Flows

### Principal/Admin Login

```
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "identifier": "principal@greenfield.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "deviceId": "device-001",
  "deviceName": "Chrome Browser"
}

Response:
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "user": {
    "id": "principal_1",
    "name": "Mr Taiwo Adebayo",
    "email": "principal@greenfield.com",
    "role": "PRINCIPAL",
    "schoolId": "school_1",
    "schoolName": "Greenfield Secondary School"
  }
}
```

### Teacher Login

Same endpoint, but response includes teacher's assignments:

```

{
  "identifier": "adeyemi@greenfield.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "deviceId": "device-002",
  "deviceName": "Chrome Browser"
}

Response:
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "user": {

      { "id": "assign_3", "type": "subject", "classId": "jss1b", "subjectId": "mathematics" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Token Management

### Token Strategy: Refresh Tokens with Offline Grace Period

**Two Token Types:**

1. **Access Token**
   - Short-lived: 1 hour expiry
   - Sent in every API request (`Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}`)
   - Used to verify user is still active and haven't been deactivated

2. **Refresh Token**
   - Long-lived: 30 days expiry
   - Stored securely in HTTP-only cookie
   - Used to silently refresh access token when it expires
   - Only sent back to server, never exposed to client-side JavaScript

### Offline Grace Period

**Problem:** Teacher marking attendance offline, token expires, they get logged out and lose work.

**Solution:** When offline and token expires, **keep the user logged in locally** until they come back online. Then:

1. Try to refresh the token
2. If refresh succeeds, update access token
3. If refresh fails (still offline), retry silently in background
4. Only force logout if offline for 30 days (extremely unlikely)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// When access token expires but user is offline
if (!isOnline && tokenExpired) {
  // Keep working locally, queue a refresh for when online
  keepUserLoggedIn();
  queueTokenRefresh();
} else if (isOnline) {
  // Online: must refresh before continuing
  refreshToken();
}
```

### Endpoint: Refresh Token

```
POST /api/auth/refresh
{
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGc..."
}

Response:
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",  // new short-lived token
  "expiresIn": 3600             // seconds until expiry
}
```

## Password Reset

### Forgot Password Flow

1. User lands on "Forgot Password" page
2. Enters email
3. Backend sends email with reset link (token valid for 1 hour)
4. User clicks link, lands on password reset form
5. User enters new password
6. Backend verifies token, updates password
7. User redirected to login

**Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/auth/forgot-password
{ "email": "teacher@greenfield.com" }

POST /api/auth/reset-password
{
  "token": "reset_token_123",
  "newPassword": "newPassword123"
}
```

---

## Multi-Device Sync Strategy

### Device Model

```
Device {
  id: string              // unique per device
  userId: string
  schoolId: string
  type: 'phone' | 'tablet' | 'web'
  isPrimary: boolean      // only one primary per user
  lastSyncAt: number      // when last sync occurred
  createdAt: number
}
```

### Rules

1. **Primary Device** (usually phone)
   - Can write offline, sync later
   - Used in classroom for attendance
   - Teacher sets on first login

2. **Secondary Devices** (laptop, tablet)
   - Can read offline
   - Writes require connectivity
   - Show warning if trying to write offline: "Your primary device is [Phone]. Changes here will sync when both devices are online."

### Sync Flow on Device Login/Connectivity Return

```
1. Identify device (localStorage or IndexedDB)
2. Check if primary or secondary
3. Push all local pending changes to server
4. Pull all server changes since lastSyncAt
5. Run conflict detection
6. Resolve conflicts (majority: last-write-wins)
7. Update local Dexie with server state
8. Update lastSyncAt timestamp
9. Mark sync complete
```

### Conflict Resolution (MVP)

For MVP, use **last-write-wins silently** with logging:

```
If two devices edit the same record while offline:
- Compare updatedAt timestamp
- Keep version with most recent timestamp
- Log conflict to server table for later analysis
```

Later iteration: Show conflict UI to teacher for significant conflicts (>30 min apart suggests genuine simultaneous edits).

### Session Management

Teacher can view and revoke active sessions:

```
Active Sessions
─────────────────────────────
iPhone 13          Lagos    Now
Samsung Galaxy     Lagos    2 days ago
Chrome, MacBook    Lagos    5 days ago

[Log out all other devices]
```

---

## Teacher Deactivation

When principal removes a teacher, access revokes immediately:

1. Principal clicks "Remove Teacher"
2. Backend sets `Teacher.active = false`
3. On next API request from that teacher, validate `active` status (don't just trust token)
4. Teacher gets logged out and shown "Your access has been revoked"

---

## Security Considerations

### Password Hashing
- Use **bcryptjs** with salt rounds 10+
- Never store plaintext passwords

### Token Secrets
- Store `JWT_SECRET` in environment variables only
- Different secrets for access vs refresh tokens in production

### School Isolation (Multi-tenant)
- Every query filters by `schoolId`
- Teachers can only access their own school
- No cross-school data leakage

### Invite Token Expiry
- Invite tokens expire in 48 hours
- Principal can resend if teacher doesn't accept in time

### Password Reset Token Expiry
- Reset tokens expire in 1 hour
- One-time use only
